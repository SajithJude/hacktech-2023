# Problem

 Machine learning involves the use of algorithms to train models that can make predictions or classifications based on input data. However, the performance of a machine learning model depends on many factors, including the choice of parameters and the preprocessing of the input data.

For beginners and non-programmers, choosing the right parameters for model training and data preprocessing can be challenging. This is because they may not have a deep understanding of how these parameters work, or they may not know which parameters are most important for a given task.

For example, in a neural network, the number of hidden layers, the number of neurons per layer, the activation functions used, and the learning rate are all important parameters that affect the model's performance. In data preprocessing, the choice of normalization techniques, feature selection methods, and handling of missing values are just a few of the many factors that can affect the quality of the input data.

Furthermore, different datasets may require different parameter settings and preprocessing techniques, making it difficult for beginners to generalize their knowledge and apply it to new problems. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that there is no "one-size-fits-all" solution for choosing parameters and preprocessing techniques, as the optimal settings depend on the specific problem and the data at hand.

In summary, the inability of non-programmers and beginners to choose the right parameters for model training and data preprocessing can lead to poor performance of machine learning models, and can hinder progress in the field.
